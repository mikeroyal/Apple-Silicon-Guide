 **Apple Vision Pro Headset Specs:**
   
   * Powered by an M2 chip and **R1 chip(dedicated toward real-time sensor processing for the 12 cameras and 5 sensors on the Vision Pro headset)**.
   * High-resolution 4K micro OLED displays.
   * Display refresh rate of [90Hz and supports a special 96Hz mode for 24fps video](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10071/?time=143).
   * Display Pixel Size will be between 3000 ppi-4000 ppi.
   * Display offers a brightness of 5,000 nits.
   * The color gamut is quoted as DCI > 97% DCI.
   * 96W USB-C power adapter.
   * A USB-C port for data transfer.
   * A proprietary magnetic port(MagSafe) to attach the [battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT).
   * Expected battery life of about **2 hours per pack**.
   * 12 optical cameras and 5 sensors for tracking movements, mapping the environment, and projecting visual experiences. 
   * WiFi 6E, which adds 6GHz spectrum to the 2.4GHz & 5GHz bands for increased bandwidth and less device interference.

OLEDoS (OLED on Silicon) is a display panel that typically has a diagonal length of less than 1 inch and meets the 3000 ppi-4000 ppi resolution criteria of AR/VR device displays. Existing OLED displays use Low-Temperature-Poly-Silicon (LTPS) or Oxide TFT based on glass substrates. OLEDoS uses silicon-wafer-based CMOS substrates. Using silicon substrates, ultra-fine circuit structures typically used in semiconductor processes can be reproduced, which in turn lead to the creation of ultra-high-resolution OLEDs when organic matter is deposited on them.

 **LG and Sony OLEDoS Display Specs:**
 
   * High-resolution 4K micro OLED displays.
   * Display Pixel Size will be between 3000 ppi-4000 ppi.
   * Display offers a brightness of 5,000 nits.
   * The color gamut is quoted as DCI > 97% DCI.

## Universal Control
[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

Much like SideCar, there are limited settings for Universal Control. Without a second device connected, you can go to System Preferences -> Displays and click Advanced to pull up Universal Control settings. If a device is already connected, you'll have to go to Displays -> Display Settings -> Advanced.

<p align="center">

<br />
</p>

Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Handoff must be enabled on each device, and they must be within 30 feet. If you prefer to use Universal Control wired, the devices can be connected via USB and you must trust your Mac on your iPad. At the moment, Apple does not mention support for Ethernet but we will test this ourselves during the beta period.

You must also have supported devices. Apple says supported devices include:

 - MacBook Pro (2016 and later)
 - MacBook (2016 and later)

### Enable full disk encryption

Full disk encryption is pretty much self-explanatory. You want to encrypt your disk, so you prevent unauthorized access to your data.

To turn on full disk encryption on macOS:

1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault
2. Click on the lock on the bottom left side of the screen to authenticate (you need to authenticate to make changes, in this case, to turn on full disk encryption)
3. Click Turn On FileVault... and follow the procedure step by step

### Firewall Filtering

[Back to The Top](#table-of-contents)

**Firewall** is a system that provides network security by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of user-defined rules. In general, the purpose of a firewall is to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of unwanted network communications while allowing all legitimate communication to flow freely.

[Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) is a host-based application firewall for macOS. It can be used to monitor applications, preventing or permitting them to connect to attached networks through advanced rules.

### MFA

[Back to The Top](#table-of-contents)

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** is when you sign into your online accounts - a process we call "authentication" - you're proving to the service that you are who you say you are. Traditionally that's been done with a username and a password.

[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) is a security device that makes two-factor authentication as simple as possible. Instead of a code being texted to you, or generated by an app on your phone, you simply press a button on your YubiKey. Each device has a unique code built on to it, which is used to generate codes that help confirm your identity. The YubiKey USB authenticator includes NFC and has multi-protocol support including FIDO2, FIDO U2F, Yubico OTP, OATH-TOTP, OATH-HOTP, Smart card (PIV), OpenPGP, and Challenge-Response capability to give you strong hardware-based authentication.

[Game Porting Toolkit](https://github.com/apple/homebrew-apple/tree/main/Formula) is Apple's new translation layer which combines Wine with Apple's own D3DMetal which supports [DirectX 9 through 12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX). Games that use anti-cheat([Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.easy.ac/) and [BattleEye](https://www.battleye.com/)) or aggressive [DRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) generally don't work. Games that require [AVX/AVX 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) CPUs also don't work.

 * The Game Porting Toolkit builds a [dxil](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/main/docs/DXIL.rst) to [metallib](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal) converter and DirectX11/DirectX12 to Metal runtime translator. Non-graphics APIs are translated by Wine and do not use any tech from [moltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK), [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk); or [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross). The Metal shader converter can be shipped by games and can be used in the game developer asset pipelines.
 
 * [Metal shader converter](https://developer.apple.com/metal/shader-converter/) is a tool that converts shader intermediate representations in LLVM IR bytecode into bytecode suitable to be loaded into Metal. Itâs available as a library and a standalone executable. All the functionality exposed through the library interface is available via the standalone executable.

### System Requirements
 
   * macOS Sonoma should be used, currently it is in beta. 
   * macOS Ventura causes large numbers of issues with steamwebhelper.exe crashing so it isn't recommended, use the macOS Sonoma beta.
   * [Visit Apple Developer Downloads site](https://developer.apple.com/downloads), these files are now free to download use for any logged in Apple account.
       - Search for Command Line Tools for Xcode 15 beta and download the dmg file, then install it.
       - If you have an old version Xcode installed, remove it.
       - Search for Game Porting Toolkit and download it. Open the dmg file and then run the pkg.
       
### Using Homebrew

**Note:** if you have ever installed Homebrew before, then it is advisable to remove arm64 Homebrew as this can interfere with this build process. Either use a Homebrew uninstall script or delete the folder ```/opt/homebrew/bin```.

Open Terminal (search in Spotlight on macOS).

**Install Rosetta:**

```softwareupdate --install-rosetta```

Enter an x86_64 shell to continue the following steps in a Rosetta environment. All subsequent commands should be run within this shell.

```arch -x86_64 zsh```

Install the x86_64 version of Homebrew if you don't already have it.

```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"```

**Make sure the brew command is on your path:**

```which brew```

**If this command does not print ```/usr/local/bin/brew```, you should use this command:**

```export PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}```

### Build 

**Run this command to download Apple tap:**

```brew tap apple/apple http://github.com/apple/homebrew-apple```

Install the game-porting-toolkit formula. This formula downloads and compiles several large software projects. How long this takes will depend on the speed of your computer. It can take over 1 hour to complete depending on the speed of your Mac.

```brew -v install apple/apple/game-porting-toolkit```

If during installation you see an error such as âError: game-porting-toolkit: unknown or unsupported macOS version: :dunnoâ, your version of Homebrew doesnât have macOS Sonoma support. Update to the latest version of Homebrew and try again.

```brew update brew -v install apple/apple/game-porting-toolkit```

### Wine prefix 

A Wine prefix contains a virtual C: drive. You will install the toolkit and your game into this virtual C: drive. Run the following command to create a new Wine prefix named my-game-prefix in your home directory.

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 winecfg```

   * A âWine configurationâ window should appear on your screen.
   * Change the version of Windows to Windows 10.
   * Choose Apply and then OK to exit winecfg.

If the âWine configurationâ window does not appear, and no new icon appears in the Dock, verify that you have correctly installed the x86_64 version of Homebrew as well as the game-porting-toolkit formula.

**Preparing the toolkit**

Make sure the Game Porting Toolkit dmg downloaded earlier is mounted at ```/Volumes/Game Porting Toolkit-1.0```. Use this script to copy the Game Porting Toolkit library directory into Wineâs library directory.

```ditto /Volumes/Game\ Porting\ Toolkit-1.0/lib/ `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/lib/```

**Put the 3 scripts from the Game Porting Toolkit DMG into here /usr/local/bin using this command:**

```cp /Volumes/Game\ Porting\ Toolkit*/gameportingtoolkit* /usr/local/bin```

### Steam install

<h3 align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide/assets/45159366/7c41f9fc-6195-44ac-9398-d1d32da78749">
  <br />
 
</h3>

Go to Steam website and download the Windows version of [Steam](https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/client/installer/SteamSetup.exe) and place in your Downloads folder.

**Install Steam**

```gameportingtoolkit ~/my-game-prefix ~/Downloads/SteamSetup.exe```

**Run Steam**

```gameportingtoolkit ~/my-game-prefix 'C:\Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe'```

Log into Steam A common issue is that Steam will present with a blank black window.

Alternate way of launching Steam (after installing):

```MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1 WINEESYNC=1 WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix /usr/local/Cellar/game-porting-toolkit/1.0/bin/wine64 'C:\Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe'```

If this continues then close the Terminal window and then re-open and try again, repeat until the login screen opens. Now you should be able to download and launch Windows games through Steam.

## Epic/Heroic Games and GOG support

<h3 align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide/assets/45159366/992edc00-18e8-4f51-ab7b-0f047ffb6f84">
  <br />
 
</h3>

This is particularly useful because as it currently, the real Epic Games Launcher fails to install under the Game Porting Toolkit. Heroic supports Epic and GOG.com games.

   * Install the native [macOS Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases) or from Homebrew.
   * Open Heroic, and log into your Epic Games and/or GOG.com account.
   * Go to the "Wine Manager" and install a numbered version of Wine, such that it won't auto update- we are going to modify it. 
   * At the time of writing this, the newest numbered version of Wine-Crossover is ```Wine-Crossover-Wine-22.1.0```
   * Press the folder icon that appears after installing it to open the directory containing Heroic's Wine installations.
   * Right-click on the version of Wine you just installed and press "Show Package Contents".
   * Open this directory in the Terminal.
       * If you have **"OpenInTerminal"** this is one button, otherwise press **"Show Path Bar"** and navigate where it says with **"cd"**.
       * It should be something like ```cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/heroic/tools/wine/Wine-crossover-wine-22.1.0```.

   ```cd Contents/MacOS```

   **Remove the existing Wine:**

   ```rm wine```

  ###  Create a symlink to Game Porting Toolkit's Wine
        
   **If using Game Porting Toolkit Wineprefix:**

   ```ln -s `/usr/local/bin/brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 wine```

   **If using Whisky:**

   ```ln -s /Applications/Whisky.app/Contents/Resources/Libraries/Wine/bin/wine64 wine```
      
   ``` cd ../Resources```

  **Remove the existing Wine:**

  ```rm -rfv wine```

   ### Create a symlink to Game Porting Toolkit's Wine
    
   **If using Game Porting Toolkit Wineprefix:**

   ```ln -s `/usr/local/bin/brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit` wine```

   **If using Whisky:**

   ```ln -s /Applications/Whisky.app/Contents/Resources/Libraries/Wine wine```

   * You are now done with Terminal. Install any games you want to try playing.
   * Select the game you want to play, and press the settings button in the top-right.
   * Make sure the version of Wine you just downloaded and modified is selected.
   * Make sure your Game Porting Toolkit Wine Prefix is selected. If you followed Apple's guide this is ```/Users/you/my-game-prefix```.

## Battle.net

<h3 align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/mikeroyal/Apple-Silicon-Guide/assets/45159366/fc90046c-797d-47cb-9073-25af1d847660">
  <br />
 
</h3>

Please download the [Windows version of Battle.net](https://download.battle.net/en-gb/?platform=windows).

**Make a new Wineprefix for Battle.net - we will refer to this as battle-net from now:**

```WINEPREFIX=~/battle-net `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 winecfg```

  *  A âWine configurationâ window should appear on your screen.
  *  Change the version of Windows to Windows 10.
  *  Choose Apply and then OK to exit winecfg.

Run Battle.net launcher

```gameportingtoolkit ~/battle-net ~/Downloads/Battle.net-Setup.exe```

Please be aware that there is an issue launching Battle.net once installed, the only current way to re-login is to 'install' the launcher again.

Start individual game without the launcher using this command:

```arch -x86_64 gameportingtoolkit-no-hud ~/battle-net 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Diablo IV\Diablo IV Launcher.exe'```

### Launching individual game

Open your Wine prefixâs virtual C: drive in Finder ```(open ~/my-game-prefix/drive_c)``` and copy your game into an appropriate subdirectory.

**A. Standard launching**

```gameportingtoolkit ~/my-game-prefix 'C:\Program Files\MyGame\MyGame.exe'```

This launches the given Windows game binary with a visible extended Metal Performance HUD and filters logging to output from the Game Porting Toolkit.

**B. Launching without a HUD**

```gameportingtoolkit-no-hud ~/my-game-prefix 'C:\Program Files\MyGame\MyGame.exe'```

**C. Launching with Wine ESYNC disable**

```gameportingtoolkit-no-esync ~/my-game-prefix 'C:\Program Files\MyGame\MyGame.exe'```

### Logging 

The provided ```bin/gameportingtoolkit*``` scripts can be copied onto your path to facilitate different forms of logging and launching. You can run these scripts from any shell; you donât need to switch to the Rosetta environment first.

Logging output will appear in the Terminal window in which you launch your game as well as the system log, which can be viewed with the Console app found in Applications â¸ Utilities. Log messages from the Game Porting Toolkit are prefixed with D3DM. By default the gameportingtoolkit* scripts will filter to just the D3DM-prefixed messages.
Troubleshooting â¢ Link

### Steam login black screen

Close the Terminal window and then reopen and retry the command, repeat several times.

Alternate way of launching Steam (after installing):

```MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1 WINEESYNC=1 WINEPREFIX=<path to the Wine bottle you set up> /usr/local/Cellar/game-porting-toolkit/1.0/bin/wine64 'C:\Program Files (x86)/Steam/steam.exe'```

If still not working then try using CrossOver and create a Steam bottle, then redirect this WINEPREFIX to that bottle:

```WINEPREFIX="/Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/Steam/"```

**Steam crashes straight after opening:** Disconnect any external monitors.

**Battle.net launcher won't re-launch:** Re-install the launcher to reopen, no other fix at the moment.

Game wonât run because it thinks the version of Windows is too old. Some games detect specific minimum versions of Windows and need to be updated. Use this script to update your wineprefix with build 19042 which should work for most games e.g. Spider-Man Remastered.

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 reg add 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' /v CurrentBuild /t REG_SZ /d 19042 /f```

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 reg add 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion' /v CurrentBuildNumber /t REG_SZ /d 19042 /f```

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wineserver -k```

**steamwebhelper.exe crashes**

This is caused by Steam being run through macOS Ventura or below, upgrade to macOS Sonoma.

**Game won't run and crashes with an invalid instruction**

**Invalid instruction** crashes are often (but not always) caused when Rosetta 2 is unable to translate AVX/AVX2 instructions. You may be able to recompile a version of your game without AVX/AVX2 instructions in order to evaluate its potential on Apple Silicon with the Game Porting Toolkit when you hit this error. When porting your code natively to Apple Silicon, NEON instructions are a high-performance replacement for AVX/AVX2.

**Game won't run because its anti-cheat or DRM software is incompatible with Wine translation.**

You may be able to rebuild a custom version of your game in your Windows development environment with anti-cheat or DRM disabled for your own evaluation purposes. When porting your code natively to Apple Silicon and macOS, contact your anti-cheat or DRM providerâmost have native Apple Silicon solutions for your native build.

**Game wonât run because it requires Mono, .NET, or the MSVCRT runtime.**

The game porting toolkitâs evaluation environment does not pre-install these runtime support packages. If your game makes use of one of these packages, consider searching for and downloading appropriate installers (.exe or .msi) and installing them to your evaluation environment. Additional runtime installers can be run on your environment by just launching the installer and following its installation instructions:

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 <some-installer.exe>```

And .MSI packages can be installed by launching the Windows uninstaller application and choosing to install a downloaded .msi package:

```WINEPREFIX=~/my-game-prefix `brew --prefix game-porting-toolkit`/bin/wine64 uninstaller```

**Controller issues**

Issues may be fixed by enrolling into the Steam beta.

## Gaming on Xbox Game Pass

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

**Note:** Xbox Game Pass Cloud Gaming can be accessed on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS through [Apple's Safari browser](https://support.xbox.com/help/games-apps/cloud-gaming/setup-cloud-gaming-apple), though, for the best performance I recommend using [Microsoft's Edge browser](https://www.microsoft.com/edge/download?form=MA13FJ). Also, you can use [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) to run games on Windows 11 within macOS. Though, only 2D (Hollow Knight, Celeste, etc..) and lower graphics games run well natively with Parallels.

[Xbox Game Pass](https://xbox.com/xbox-game-pass) is a video game subscription services from Microsoft starting at $9.99 and $14.99 for the [Ultimate Pass](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/ultimate).

## Setting up Game Pass for Offline use (Windows Only)
 
 * **Make sure to use [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) to run Windows 11 on macOS. Also, only 2D (Hollow Knight, Celeste, etc..) and lower graphics games run well natively with Parallels.**

 * **Note:** Most games with a campaign mode will be playable offline, but games with network co-op or multiplayer features will not work while youâre offline. Before you go offline, connect to the Xbox network to sync your most recent game save to the cloud. While you play offline, your game save progress will continue to be saved locally, and itâll sync the next time you sign in to Xbox. If you want to continue playing on a different device, youâll need to go online and connect to the Xbox network to allow your local saved game to sync with the cloud again.

 * **Note 2:** PC Game Pass game licenses expire after 30 days when playing offline, and licenses for owned games expire after 14 days. To keep playing your game offline, go back online and launch the game. This renews the gameâs license on your device and ensures you can go back to playing offline.  

You can only have one device as your designated offline device. **To set your device as your designated offline device:**

  * Make sure that youâre online.
  * Check that your device has the latest Windows updates: **Go to Start -> Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update and see if any relevant updates are available**.
  * Open the Microsoft Store. Youâll be prompted to sign in if you havenât already.
  * Select your profile icon in the upper right corner.
  * Select App settings, and then under Offline permissions, make sure that the toggle is set to On.

Once you set this, any devices previously designated as offline will be toggled to Off, and youâll no longer be able to play games offline on those devices.

**Prepare your game or games**

Once your device is set up, youâll need to launch each game you want to play offline while signed in to the Xbox network. You only need to do this once per game, and youâll need to do this even if youâve already launched the game on your device.

  * Make sure that youâre online, and that your device is set as your designated offline device. (See the steps above for details on how to do this.)
  * Launch the game you want to play offline. When prompted, sign in to Xbox.
  * Once youâve started playing the game, you can exit at any time.

Repeat this process for each game you want to play offline. Once completed, you can go offline at any time and launch those games whenever you want to play them, without needing to sign in online each time.

 **Blender VFX(Visual Effects). Source: [Blender](https://www.blender.org)**

[FreeStyle](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/freestyle/index.html) is an edge- and line-based non-photorealistic (NPR) rendering engine. It relies on mesh data and z-depth information to draw lines on selected edge types. Various line styles can be added to produce artistic (âhand drawnâ, âpaintedâ, etc.) or technical (hard line) looks.

[Modifiers](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/modeling/modifiers/introduction.html) are automatic operations that affect an object in a non-destructive way. With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be too tedious to update manually (such as subdivision surfaces) and without affecting the base geometry of your object.

[UV Unwrapping](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/editing/uv/unwrapping/introduction.html) is a tool that let's you easily unwrap your mesh right inside Blender, and use image textures or paint your own directly onto the model.

[UV Sculpt](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/modeling/meshes/editing/uv/uv_sculpt.html) is a âmodeâ in Blender that allows you to grab, pinch and smooth UVs, just like Sculpt Mode.

[Dedicated Workspace](https://www.blender.org/features/sculpting/#dedicated-workspace) is a feature of sculpting organic subjects using the built-in sculpting feature set of Blender.

[Brushes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/sculpt_paint/sculpting/introduction.html) is a feature in Blender that comes with built-in brushes such as Crease, Clay Strips, Pinch, Grab, Smooth, Mask and many more.

[Dynamic topology( dyntopo)](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/sculpt_paint/sculpting/adaptive.html) is a dynamic tessellation sculpting method, which adds and removes details on the fly, whereas regular sculpting only affects the shape of a mesh.

[Masking](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/sculpt_paint/sculpting/hide_mask.html#mask) is a feature used while sculpting, areas might be hidden behind parts of the mesh or they might be too close to other parts. To work through these, it is useful to isolate parts of a mesh to sculpt on. This can be done by either completely hiding parts of the mesh or by masking areas that can not be sculpted on.

[Grease Pencil](https://www.blender.org/features/grease-pencil/) is a particular type of Blender object that allow you to draw in the 3D space. It can be use to make traditional 2D animation, cut-out animation, motion graphics or use it as storyboard tool among other things.

[Constraints](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/animation/constraints/index.html) are a way to control an objectâs properties (e.g. its location, rotation, scale), using either plain static values (like the âlimitâ ones), or another object, called âtargetâ (like e.g. the âcopyâ ones).

[Shape keys](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/animation/shape_keys/introduction.html) are used to deform objects into new shapes for animation. In other terminology, shape keys may be called âmorph targetsâ or âblend shapesâ. The most popular use cases for shape keys are in character facial animation and in tweaking and refining a skeletal rig. They are particularly useful for modeling organic soft parts and muscles where there is a need for more control over the resulting shape than what can be achieved with combination of rotation and scale.

[Motion Paths](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/animation/motion_paths.html) is a tool allows you to visualize the motion of points as paths over a series of frames. These points can be object origins and bone joints.

[Simulations](https://www.blender.org/features/simulation/) is a tool that allows you to create amazing Simulations such as a crumbling building, rain, fire, smoke, fluid, cloth or full on destruction.

[Blender Video Editor](https://www.blender.org/features/video-editing/) is a video editor that comes with a built-in video sequence editor allows you to perform basic actions like video cuts and splicing, as well as more complex tasks like video masking or color grading.

[Blender Compositing](https://www.blender.org/features/vfx/#compositing) is a feature that comes with an impressive library of nodes for creating camera fx, color grading, vignettes and much more
Render-layer support. Along with the ability to render to multiLayer OpenEXR files.

[Blender Motion Tracking](https://www.blender.org/features/vfx/#motion-tracking) is a feature that provides production ready camera and object tracking, allowing you to import raw footage, track it, mask areas and reconstruct the camera movements live in your 3d scene.

[PV(ParaVirtualization)](https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Paravirtualization_(PV)) is an efficient and lightweight virtualization technique introduced by the Xen Project team, later adopted by other virtualization solutions. PV does not require virtualization extensions from the host CPU and thus enables virtualization on hardware architectures that do not support Hardware-assisted virtualization.

[Network functions virtualization (NFV)](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/network-functions-virtualization-nfv) is the replacement of network appliance hardware with virtual machines. The virtual machines use a hypervisor to run networking software and processes such as routing and load balancing. NFV allows for the separation of communication services from dedicated hardware, such as routers and firewalls. This separation means network operations can provide new services dynamically and without installing new hardware. Deploying network components with network functions virtualization only takes hours compared to months like with traditional networking solutions.

[Software Defined Networking (SDN)](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network. This model differs from that of traditional networks, which use dedicated hardware devices (routers and switches) to control network traffic.

[Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/network_function_virtualization_Infrastructure/3_2_2/install_guide/Cisco_VIM_Install_Guide_3_2_2/Cisco_VIM_Install_Guide_3_2_2_chapter_00.html) is a service delivery and reduce costs with high performance lifecycle management Manage the full lifecycle of the software and hardware comprising your NFV infrastructure (NFVI), and maintaining a live inventory and allocation plan of both physical and virtual resources.

[Edge](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/what-is-edge-computing) is a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources such as IoT devices or local edge servers. This proximity to data at its source can deliver strong business benefits, including faster insights, improved response times and better bandwidth availability.

[Multi-access edge computing (MEC)](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/multi-access-edge-computing) is an Industry Specification Group (ISG) within ETSI to create a standardized, open environment which will allow the efficient and seamless integration of applications from vendors, service providers, and third-parties across multi-vendor Multi-access Edge Computing platforms.

[Virtualized network functions(VNFs)](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/cso4.1/topics/concept/nsd-vnf-overview.html) is a software application used in a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) implementation that has well defined interfaces, and provides one or more component networking functions in a defined way. For example, a security VNF provides Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewall component functions.

[Cloud-Native Network Functions(CNF)](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/11/18/cloud-native-network-functions-conformance-launched-by-cncf/) is a network function designed and implemented to run inside containers. CNFs inherit all the cloud native architectural and operational principles including Kubernetes(K8s) lifecycle management, agility, resilience, and observability.

[Physical Network Function(PNF)](https://www.mpirical.com/glossary/pnf-physical-network-function) is a physical network node which has not undergone virtualization. Both PNFs and VNFs (Virtualized Network Functions) can be used to form an overall Network Service.

[Network functions virtualization infrastructure(NFVI)](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vCloud-NFV/2.0/vmware-vcloud-nfv-reference-architecture-20/GUID-FBEA6C6B-54D8-4A37-87B1-D825F9E0DBC7.html) is the foundation of the overall NFV architecture. It provides the physical compute, storage, and networking hardware that hosts the VNFs. Each NFVI block can be thought of as an NFVI node and many nodes can be deployed and controlled geographically.

[Virtualization-based Security (VBS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-vbs) is a hardware virtualization feature to create and isolate a secure region of memory from the normal operating system.

[Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/device-guard-and-credential-guard) is a mechanism whereby a hypervisor, such as Hyper-V, uses hardware virtualization to protect kernel-mode processes against the injection and execution of malicious or unverified code. Code integrity validation is performed in a secure environment that is resistant to attack from malicious software, and page permissions for kernel mode are set and maintained by the hypervisor.

### Asahi Linux Development

[Hector Martin](https://github.com/marcan) has merged the initial support for Apple M1 hardware into the Linux SOC (System On a Chip) tree for [Linux Kernel 5.13](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=0d5fe4b31785b732b71e764b55cda5c8d6e3bbbf). Also credit to developers [Sven Peter](https://github.com/svenpeter42) and [Alyssa Rosenzweig](https://github.com/alyssarosenzweig).

The Linux kernel 6.2 offers mainline support for the Apple M1 Pro, Max, and Ultra chips as work done by Asahi Linux's developers was upstreamed. Though, that does not mean you can simply install a Linux distro like Fedora, Ubuntu, or Debian with the 6.2 kernel.

  <br />
</h3>

The [AsahiLinux Apple GPU drivers](https://asahilinux.org/2022/12/gpu-drivers-now-in-asahi-linux/) features are a work-in-progress OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 support for all current Apple M-series systems. Thatâs enough for hardware acceleration with desktop environments, like GNOME and KDE. Itâs also enough for older 3D games, like Quake3 and Neverball. 

Asahi Linux Graphics Team:

   * [Alyssa Rosenzweig](https://social.treehouse.systems/@alyssa) is writing the OpenGL driver and compiler.
   * [Asahi Lina](https://vt.social/@lina) is writing the kernel driver and helping with OpenGL.
   * [Dougall Johnson](https://mastodon.social/@dougall) is reverse-engineering the instruction set with Alyssa.
   * [Ella Stanforth](https://tech.lgbt/@ella) is working on a Vulkan driver, reusing the kernel driver, the compiler, and some code shared with the OpenGL driver.

**Installing the Apple GPU Drivers:**

To get the new drivers, you need to run the linux-asahi-edge kernel and also install the mesa-asahi-edge Mesa package.

```
$ sudo pacman -Syu
$ sudo pacman -S linux-asahi-edge mesa-asahi-edge
$ sudo update-grub
```

Since only one version of Mesa can be installed at a time, pacman will prompt you to replace mesa with mesa-asahi-edge. This is normal!

**Recommendation:** Run Wayland instead of Xorg at this point, so if youâre using the KDE Plasma environment, make sure to install the Wayland session:

```$ sudo pacman -S plasma-wayland-session```

Then reboot, pick the Wayland session at the top of the login screen (SDDM), and enjoy! You might want to adjust the screen scale factor in System Settings â Display and Monitor (Plasma Wayland defaults to 100% or 200%, while 150% is often nicer). If you have âForce font DPIâ enabled under Appearance â Fonts, you should disable that (it is saved separately for Wayland and Xorg, and shouldnât be necessary on Wayland sessions). Log out and back in for these changes to fully apply.

### Fedora Linux Development

**Most of the hard work, including the kernel and boot software, was done by the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and their development team.**

### NixOS Linux Development 

* **[NixOS on Apple Silicon](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-m1)**

## UEFI Boot Standalone NixOS (February 2023)

**This build was tested with the following software:**

* **Asahi Linux kernel version 6.1.0-asahi2**
* **Asahi Linux's Mesa version 23.0.0_pre20221219-1**
* **m1n1 version v1.2.3**
* **Asahi Linux's U-Boot version 2022.10.asahi1-1**
* **Nixpkgs, as of 2023-02-21**
* **macOS stub 12.3 or later**

**NOTE:** For more general information about Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, refer to the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and [Asahi Linux Alpha installer release](https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/).

## Intro

This section will explain how to install NixOS on the internal NVMe drive of an Apple Silicon Mac using a customized version of the official NixOS install ISO, then boot it without the help of another computer. Aside from the Apple Silicon support module and AArch64 CPU, the resulting installation can be configured and operated like any other NixOS system. Your macOS install will still work normally, and you can easily switch between booting both macOS and NixOS.

**Most of the hard work, including the kernel and boot software, was done by the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and their development team.**

**Quick NixOS Intro:**

 * [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a Linux distribution built on top of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix). It has tools dedicated to DevOps and deployment tasks.

 * [Nix Tour](https://nixcloud.io/tour/) is an interactive tour that uses the actual package manager to learn you the language by example, in the browser

* [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) is a package manager and build system that parses reproducible build instructions specified in the [Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language), is a pure functional language with lazy evaluation. Nix expressions are pure functions taking dependencies as arguments and producing derivation specifying a reproducible build environment for the package. Nix stores the results of the build in unique addresses specified by a hash of the complete dependency tree, creating an immutable package store that allows for atomic upgrades, rollbacks and concurrent installation of different versions of a package, essentially eliminating [dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell).

* [Nix Expression Language](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Expression_Language) is a pure, lazy, functional language. Purity means that operations in the language don't have side-effects (for instance, there is no variable assignment). The language is not a full-featured, general purpose language. Its main job is to describe packages, compositions of packages, and the variability within packages.

* [Nixpkgs](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs) is the largest repository of [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix) packages(over 60,000 packages) and [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS) modules. The repository is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and maintained by the community, with official backing from the [NixOS Foundation](https://nixos.org/). Additionally, checkout [Language-specific package helpers](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Language-specific_package_helpers) and [Alternative Package Sets](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Alternative_Package_Sets).

 * [NixOS Packages Search](https://search.nixos.org/packages) is a tool for searching through NixOS packages.

### Warning

Damage to the macOS recovery partitions or the partition table could result in the Mac becoming unbootable and loss of all data on the internal NVMe drive. In this circumstance, a suitable USB cable and another computer which can run [idevicerestore](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore) will be required to perform a DFU upgrade and restore normal operation. Backups are always wise.

While you will end up with a fairly usable computer, the exact hardware features you want [may not be ready yet](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/%22When-will-Asahi-Linux-be-done%3F%22). Please look at the [Asahi Linux Feature Support page](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) for information. Any features marked with a kernel version or **`linux-asahi`** should be supported by NixOS too.

### Prerequisites

**The following items are required to get started:**

* Apple Silicon Mac [supported by Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support#table-of-contents) with macOS 12.3 or later and an admin account.
* For Mac mini users: tested and working HDMI monitor. Many do not work properly; if it shows the Asahi Linux logo and console when m1n1 is running, it's fine.
* USB flash drive which is at least 512MB and can be fully erased, and USB A to C adapter.
* Familiarity with the command line and installers without GUIs.
* **Optional:** x86_64 or aarch64 Linux PC or VM (any distro is fine).

### Overview

* [Software Preparation](#software-preparation): build the customized NixOS installer ISO and Asahi Linux components
* [UEFI Preparation](#uefi-preparation): use the Asahi Linux installer to set up a standard UEFI boot environment
* [Installation](#installation): boot the NixOS installer and use it to set up and install NixOS
* [Maintenance](#maintenance): repair and upgrade NixOS and the Asahi Linux components
* [Removal](#removal): restore the system to the stock state


## Software Preparation

#### Nix

This setup takes advantage of the Nix package manager, which handles downloading and compiling everything. You must first install it on your Linux host PC if it doesn't run NixOS. Most distros are compatible, and installation (and uninstallation) is simple. Instructions are available on the [NixOS website](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install).

If you can't or do not wish to install Nix and/or build these components yourself, installation ISOs are automatically built and made available from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/releases). Download the latest one, use `dd` or similar to transfer it to your USB flash drive, then skip down to the section on [UEFI Preparation](#uefi-preparation). Programs like `unetbootin` are not supported. These ISOs are fully reproducible; that is, the ISO you download will be (or should be...) bit-identical to the one you will get by following these preparation instructions.

#### NixOS Apple Silicon

Clone this repository to a suitable location on the host PC. In the future, you can update this repository using `git pull` and re-run the `nix build` commands to update things.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/
$ cd nixos-apple-silicon
```

#### m1n1

The Asahi Linux project has developed **m1n1** as a bridge between Apple's boot firmware and the Linux world. m1n1 is installed as a faux macOS kernel into a stub macOS installation. In addition to booting Linux (or U-Boot), m1n1 also sets up the hardware and allows remote control and debugging over USB.

**Change directories to the repository, then use Nix to build m1n1 and symlink the result to `m1n1`:**

```
nixos-apple-silicon$ nix build --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' .#m1n1 -o m1n1
```

m1n1 has been built and the build products are now in `m1n1/build/`. You can also run m1n1's scripts such as `chainload.py` using a command like `m1n1/bin/m1n1-chainload`.

#### U-Boot

In the default installation, m1n1 loads U-Boot and U-Boot is used to set up a standard UEFI environment from which GRUB or systemd-boot or whatever can be booted. Due to the limitations of the Apple boot picker, there must be one EFI system partition per installed OS.

**Use Nix to build U-Boot along with m1n1 and the device trees:**

```
nixos-apple-silicon$ nix build --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' .#uboot-asahi -o u-boot
```

The `.bin` file with m1n1, the device trees, and U-Boot joined together is now in `u-boot/`.

#### Kernel and Bootstrap Installer

The bootstrap NixOS installer ISO contains UEFI-compatible GRUB, the Asahi Linux kernel, its initrd, and enough packages and drivers to allow connection to the Internet in order to download and install a full NixOS system.

```
nixos-apple-silicon$ nix build --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' .#installer-bootstrap -o installer -j4 -L
```

The installer ISO is now available as `installer/iso/nixos-*.iso`. Use `dd` or similar to transfer it to your USB flash drive. Programs like `unetbootin` are not supported.

## UEFI Preparation

This setup uses the alpha Asahi Linux installer to install a stub macOS and standard UEFI boot environment from which the NixOS installer and installed OS will run. These steps must be run from Terminal.app in macOS. You must also be logged into an administrator account.

#### Asahi Linux Installation

**Download and run the alpha installer with the following command:**
```
% curl https://alx.sh | sh
```

**Choose the following options to get started:**
* Enter your administrator password
* Do not enable expert mode

**Resize your existing macOS install:**
* Resize an existing partition to make space for a new OS (`r`)
* Enter the new size of the macOS install. It should be at least 20GB less than its current size to make room for NixOS with a GUI (note that here 1GB = 1,000,000,000 bytes)
* Confirm the resize operation
* Wait patiently while the partition is resized; it will take several minutes. Do not attempt to use the machine while this is in progress.
* Press enter when finished

**Install UEFI environment:**
* Install an OS into free space (`f`)
* UEFI environment only
* Name it NixOS (this is what shows up in the firmware boot picker)
* Wait while the installation proceeds and enter your password when prompted
* Wait for the default boot volume to be set (this may take several seconds)
* Read the final advice, then press enter to shut down the machine

Boot into recovery mode by holding the power button down as directed and select the new NixOS option in the boot picker. Follow the prompts and enter your administrator password. The local policy update will take several seconds to complete. Once complete, select that you want to set a custom boot object and put your system to permissive security mode, enter your administrator username (the same one you put in the password for earlier) and password, then reboot when prompted.

If everything went well, you will restart into U-Boot with the Asahi Linux and U-Boot logos on-screen. Shut the system down by holding the power button, then proceed to the next step.

## Installation

#### Booting the Installer

Shut down the machine fully. Connect the flash drive with the installer ISO to a USB-C port through the USB A to C adapter. If on a Mac mini, you must use the USB-C ports as U-Boot does not support the USB-A ports at this time. If not using Wi-Fi, connect the Ethernet cable to the network port or adapter as well.

Start the Mac, and U-Boot should start booting from the USB drive automatically. If you've already installed something to the internal NVMe drive, U-Boot will try to boot it first. To instead boot from USB, hit a key to stop autoboot when prompted, then run the command `run bootcmd_usb0`.

GRUB will start, then the NixOS installer after a short delay (the default GRUB option is fine). You will get a console prompt once booting completes. Run the command `sudo su` to get a root prompt in the installer. If the console font is too small, run the command `setfont ter-v32n` to increase the size.


#### Partitioning and Formatting

**DANGER:** Damage to the GPT partition table, first partition (`iBootSystemContainer`), or the last partition (`RecoveryOSContainer`) could result in the loss of all data and render the Mac unbootable and unrecoverable without assistance from another computer! Do not use your distro's automated partitioner or partitioning instructions!

We will add a root partition to the remaining free space and format it as ext4. Alternative partition layouts and filesystems, including LUKS encryption, are possible, but not covered currently.

**Create the root partition to fill up the free space:**
```
nixos# sgdisk /dev/nvme0n1 -n 0:0 -s
[...]
The operation has completed successfully.
```

**Identify the number of the new root partition (type code 8300, typically second to last):**
```
nixos# sgdisk /dev/nvme0n1 -p
Disk /dev/nvme0n1: 244276265 sectors, 931.8 GiB
Model: APPLE SSD AP1024Q                       
Sector size (logical/physical): 4096/4096 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): 27054D2E-307A-41AA-9A8C-3864D56FAF6B
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 5
First usable sector is 6, last usable sector is 244276259
Partitions will be aligned on 1-sector boundaries
Total free space is 0 sectors (0 bytes)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
   1               6          128005   500.0 MiB   FFFF  iBootSystemContainer
   2          128006       219854567   838.2 GiB   AF0A  Container
   3       219854568       220465127   2.3 GiB     AF0A  
   4       220465128       220590311   489.0 MiB   EF00  
   5       220590312       242965550   85.4 GiB    8300  
   6       242965551       244276259   5.0 GiB     FFFF  RecoveryOSContainer
```

**Format the new root partition:**
```
nixos# mkfs.ext4 -L nixos /dev/nvme0n1p5
```

#### NixOS Configuration

The subsequent steps in this section will help you install NixOS onto your new partitions. More information is available in the Installing section of the [NixOS manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-installing). Some changes to the configuration procedure as described in that manual are needed for NixOS on Apple Silicon to work properly.

**Mount the root partition, then the EFI system partition that was created by the Asahi Linux installer specifically for NixOS:**
```
nixos# mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
nixos# mkdir -p /mnt/boot
nixos# mount /dev/disk/by-partuuid/`cat /proc/device-tree/chosen/asahi,efi-system-partition` /mnt/boot
```

**Create a default configuration for the new system, then copy the Apple Silicon support module into it:**
```
nixos# nixos-generate-config --root /mnt
nixos# cp -r /etc/nixos/apple-silicon-support /mnt/etc/nixos/
nixos# chmod -R +w /mnt/etc/nixos/
```

Use vim (or any editor of your choice) to edit the configuration of the new system to include the Apple Silicon support module. Be aware that other editors and most documentation has been left out of the bootstrap installer to save space and time.
```
nixos# vim /mnt/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
```

Add the `./apple-silicon-support` directory to the imports list and switch off the `canTouchEfiVariables` option. That portion of the file should look like this:
```
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      # Include the necessary packages and configuration for Apple Silicon support.
      ./apple-silicon-support
    ];

  # Use the systemd-boot EFI boot loader.
  boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
  boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = false;
```

If you used the cross-compiled installer image, i.e. **you downloaded the ISO from GitHub or built it on an `x86_64-linux` machine, you may add the following line to re-use the cross-compiled Asahi packages**. If you don't, they will be rebuilt in the installer, which wastes time. When you update the system and they need to be rebuilt on the Mac itself, remove this line or you will get an error that an `x86_64-linux` builder is required.
```
  # Remove if you get an error that an x86_64-linux builder is required.
  hardware.asahi.pkgsSystem = "x86_64-linux";
```

The configuration above is the minimum required to produce a bootable system, but you can further edit the file as desired to perform additional configuration. Uncomment the relevant options and change their values as explained in the file. Note that some advertised features may not work properly at this time. Refer to the [NixOS installation manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-configuration) for further guidance.

Various non-free non-redistributable peripheral firmware files are required to use system hardware like Wi-Fi. The Asahi Linux installer grabs these from macOS and stores them on the EFI system partition when it is created. The NixOS installer loads them from there while booting so that all hardware is available during installation. By default, the Apple Silicon support module will automatically reference the files in the EFI system partition and incorporate them into your configuration to be managed by the normal NixOS mechanisms.

Currently, the only supported way to update the peripheral firmware files is to destroy and re-create the EFI system partition, so they will not change unexpectedly. If you do not want the impurity of referencing them (or are using flakes where this is prohibited), copy them off the EFI system partition (e.g. on the installation ISO `mkdir -p /mnt/etc/nixos/firmware && cp /mnt/boot/asahi/{all_firmware.tar.gz,kernelcache*} /mnt/etc/nixos/firmware`) and specify this path in your configuration:
```
  # Specify path to peripheral firmware files.
  hardware.asahi.peripheralFirmwareDirectory = ./firmware;
  # Or disable extraction and management of them completely.
  # hardware.asahi.extractPeripheralFirmware = false;
```

You can choose to build the Asahi kernel with a 4K page size by enabling the appropriate option. This results in a reduction in raw compilation speed of 10-25%, but improves software compatibility in some cases (such as with Chromium/Electron and x86 emulation).
```
  # Build the kernel with 4K pages to improve software compatibility at
  # the cost of performance in some cases.
  hardware.asahi.use4KPages = true;
```

If you want to install a desktop environment, you will have to uncomment the option to enable X11 and NetworkManager, then add an option to include your favorite desktop environment. You may also wish to include graphical packages such as `firefox` in `environment.systemPackages`. For example, to install Xfce:
```
  # Enable the X11 windowing system.
  services.xserver.enable = true;
  services.xserver.desktopManager.xfce.enable = true;
```

Some keyboard layouts are not detected correctly. On some devices, the \` key is swapped with `<`, and `~` with `>`. The layout can be fixed by setting options in `boot.extraModprobeConfig`. Which option needs to be set depends on your hardware keyboard's layout (see: [Arch Wiki - Apple Keyboard](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Apple_Keyboard)).
 ```
 # For ` to < and ~ to > (for those with US keyboards)
 boot.extraModprobeConfig = ''
   options hid_apple iso_layout=0
 '';
 ```

#### NixOS Installation

Once you are happy with your initial configuration, you may install the system. This will have to download a large amount of data.

You can configure wireless networking in the installer using `wpa_supplicant` by following [the minimal installer directions](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-booting-networking) in the NixOS manual.

Once the network is set up, ensure the time is set correctly, then install the system. You will be asked to set a root password as the final step:
```
nixos# systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
nixos# nixos-install
[...]
setting root password...
New password: ******
Retype new password: ******
passwd: password updated successfully
installation finished!
```

If there are any errors, or you mess up entering the root password, you can edit the configuration and safely re-run the command.

**Once complete, reboot the system:**
```
nixos# reboot
```

When the system reboots, the bootloader will come up and boot the default configuration after a short delay. Once NixOS boots, log in with the root password, and create your account, or set your user account password if you created your account in the configuration. To learn more about NixOS's configuration system, read the section in the manual on [changing the configuration](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-changing-config).

#### Dual Booting

The machine is now set up to boot NixOS by default when turned on. To access the boot picker, turn off the machine, then hold the power button to turn the machine on instead of just pressing it. Let go once the options come up. To boot a particular OS once, click on it, then click Continue underneath it. To switch the default OS, click on the desired default, hold Option (Alt), then click Always Use underneath it.

#### Hypervisor Boot

By selecting the appropriate menu option in the Asahi Linux installer, you can also choose to install m1n1 without U-Boot and run U-Boot, the bootloader, and the OS under m1n1's hypervisor.

To run U-Boot under the hypervisor, start m1n1 and attach the Mac to the host PC using an appropriate USB cable, change directories to the repo, then run:

```
nixos-apple-silicon$ m1n1/bin/m1n1-run_guest --raw u-boot/m1n1-u-boot.bin
```

To access the serial console, in a separate terminal run:

```
$ nix-shell -p picocom --run 'picocom /dev/ttyACM1'
```

Downloading the kernel over USB using m1n1 is not supported.

## Maintenance

#### System Rescue

If something goes wrong and NixOS doesn't boot or is otherwise unusable, you can first try rolling back to a previous generation. Instead of selecting the default bootloader option, choose another configuration that worked previously.

If something is seriously wrong and the bootloader does not work (or you don't have any other generations), you will want to get back into the installer. To start the installer with a system installed on the internal disk, shut down the computer, re-insert the USB drive with the installer, start it up again, hit a key in U-Boot when prompted to stop autoboot, then run the command `run bootcmd_usb0`.

Once in the installer, you can re-mount your root partition and EFI system partition without reformatting them. Depending on what exactly went wrong, you might need to edit your configuration, copy over the latest Apple Silicon support module, or update U-Boot using the latest installer.

Rerunning the installer will create a new generation but not touch any user data. This means you can "undo" the installation by selecting a previous generation in the bootloader. To redo the installation without changing your root password or changing the version of Nixpkgs, run:
```
# nixos-install --no-root-password --no-channel-copy
```

In the extreme case, you can delete the EFI system partition and stub macOS install and rerun the Asahi Linux installer, then follow the steps above to reinstall NixOS's bootloader menu. You will need to regenerate the hardware configuration using `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt` because the EFI system partition's ID will change. This shouldn't modify your root partition or other NixOS configuration, but of course it's always smart to have a backup. You might also wish to re-copy the peripheral firmware files.

#### NixOS Updates

NixOS itself can be updated like any other NixOS system. In brief, this is as follows:
```
$ sudo nix-channel --update
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

You may have to reboot after updating in some cases. If something goes wrong, you can boot a previous generation and roll back the channel update. For more details, consult the [Upgrading section](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-upgrading) of the NixOS manual.

#### Apple Silicon Support Updates

To update the Apple Silicon support module, including the Asahi kernel, U-Boot, and m1n1, you can simply download newer files from this repo under `apple-silicon-support` and place them under `/etc/nixos/apple-silicon-support`. Any changes will require a configuration rebuild and reboot to take effect. If you wish to customize your kernel, you can edit the kernel config in `/etc/nixos/apple-silicon-support/kernel/config`. Consult the comments in `/etc/nixos/apple-silicon-support/kernel/default.nix` and `/etc/nixos/apple-silicon-support/kernel/package.nix` for more details. **Note that if the kernel device trees change, U-Boot will need to be updated too.**

U-Boot and m1n1 are automatically managed by NixOS' bootloader system. If you roll back to a previous generation and things do not work properly due to a device tree incompatibility, you can run `/run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration switch` then reboot to force the bootloader and the correct version of U-Boot/m1n1 to be reinstalled and loaded.

If you want the Apple Silicon support module to be upgraded in tandem with NixOS instead of manually downloading new files, you can add it as a channel with the following command:
```
$ sudo nix-channel --add https://github.com/tpwrules/nixos-apple-silicon/archive/main.tar.gz apple-silicon-support
```

Modify your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` to reference the channel instead of the local files:
```
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      # Include the necessary packages and configuration for Apple Silicon support.
      <apple-silicon-support/apple-silicon-support>
    ];
```

**You can now update NixOS as normal. Note that Apple Silicon support module updates will generally require reboots to load new kernels and other boot components:**
```
$ sudo nix-channel --update
$ sudo nixos-rebuild switch
$ sudo reboot
```

#### Recovering from Boot Failure with `idevicerestore`

In extremely extreme circumstances (i.e. something messed up the firmware partition, recovery partition, or partition table), your Mac may fail to boot. On the Mac mini (and presumably Mac Studio), this state is identifiable by a flashing orange power light indicating the Morse code for SOS. On a Mac laptop, this state is identifiable by an illustration of an exclamation point in a circle on the screen with a link to Apple's website.

To make the Mac bootable again, you can use [idevicerestore](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/idevicerestore) from another Mac or Linux x86_64 or aarch64 VM or computer that has an Internet connection. You will need a USB cable with at least one USB-C end. This procedure has been tested with Mac and Linux hosts restoring a Mac mini with macOS 12.4.

Please note that this procedure may require you to unrecoverably destroy all data on the Mac's internal drive. If erasing is necessary, you will be clearly warned and asked to confirm before it happens. The drive will end up zeroed and its encryption keys (probably) regenerated, so not even the NSA will be able to save you. If you haven't made backups, make peace with yourself now.

You'll need to build `idevicerestore` from source to get a version capable of restoring Apple Silicon Macs. If Nix is already installed on your second computer, an appropriate version is already packaged in recent `nixpkgs-unstable`. **Check out and build both `idevicerestore` and `usbmuxd` (if on Linux):**

```
# git clone https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/
# cd nixpkgs
# nix-build -A pkgs.idevicerestore -o idevicerestore
# nix-build -A pkgs.usbmuxd -o usbmuxd # if on Linux
```

To start the procedure, hook up the appropriate port on your unbootable Mac to the second computer and invoke DFU mode. This process is covered by Steps 1 and 2 of [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-configurator-mac/revive-or-restore-a-mac-with-apple-silicon-apdd5f3c75ad/mac). We will first try what Apple calls a "revive" where the disk is not erased, although both we and `idevicerestore` still call it a "restore".

If DFU mode was started correctly, the unbootable Mac will show up on your second computer as an `Apple, Inc. Mobile Device (DFU Mode)` in `lsusb` on Linux or System Information on macOS. If you see `Apple, Inc. Apple Mobile Device [Recovery Mode]` instead (or nothing), the procedure was not followed correctly and you need to try again.

Open a terminal on your second computer and, if you are on Linux and didn't install the udev rules (which Nix did not), start `usbmuxd` in the background by running it without any arguments. Then, ask `idevicerestore` to restore the firmware by using the `--latest` flag. If you wish to erase the disk either because the revive didn't work or because you want to start with a clean slate, use the `--erase` flag also.

```
# sudo usbmuxd/bin/usbmuxd # Linux only
# sudo idevicerestore/bin/idevicerestore --latest
idevicerestore 1.0.0-unstable-2022-05-22
Found device in DFU mode
Identified device as j274ap, Macmini9,1
The following firmwares are currently being signed for Macmini9,1:
[...]
Select the firmware you want to restore:
```

Once `idevicerestore` detects the unbootable Mac, select the desired firmware (usually number `1`) and wait patiently while the firmware is downloaded; it's about 13GiB. If `idevicerestore` doesn't detect the unbootable Mac, make sure that your cables are hooked up correctly, that you used `sudo`, and that you are using a suitably recent version.

The restore process will automatically start once the firmware is downloaded and verified. If `idevicerestore` fails with the message `ERROR: Device did not disconnect. Possibly invalid iBEC. Reset device and try again.`, the unbootable Mac is likely not in DFU mode, or there is something wrong with your system's udev related to hotplug events. Check that you followed Apple's procedure correctly and that the appropriate USB device is detected.

After 30 seconds of messages and status updates, you should see the Apple logo on the unbootable Mac's screen with a progress bar and `idevicerestore` will tell you that it is `Waiting for device to enter restore mode...`. If the unbootable Mac resets after a couple minutes and you get the message `ERROR: Device failed to enter restore mode. Please make sure that usbmuxd is running.`, then `usbmuxd` is likely not running. Start it and try again.

Once the restore process starts, the progress bar will start moving and `idevicerestore` will spam lots of information about the process. If it fails with `ERROR: Unable to restore device`, your only choice may be to restart the process, but this time pass the `--erase` flag to `idevicerestore` and destroy all data on the unbootable Mac's internal drive.

Otherwise, wait patiently while the restore proceeds. Expect it to take 20 or 30 minutes at least. Eventually `idevicerestore` will say `DONE` and the formerly-unbootable Mac will reboot and start recovery mode (if erasing was not necessary) or the out-of-the-box wizard (if the disk was erased) and you can use it again.

Finally, shut down `usbmuxd` if on Linux and you started it manually. To clean up your second computer, remove the downloaded firmware, the `idevicerestore` and `usbmuxd` GC roots, and run the Nix garbage collector:
```
# sudo killall usbmuxd # if on Linux
# sudo rm -rf *.ipsw* UniversalMac*
# rm -f result* usbmuxd idevicerestore
# nix-collect-garbage
```

## Removal

#### Host PC Cleanup

To recover the space on the host PC, change directories into the repo, remove the built symlinks (removing just the installer will recover almost all the space), then run the garbage collector:

```
nixos-apple-silicon$ rm m1n1 u-boot installer result
nixos-apple-silicon$ nix-collect-garbage
```

#### NixOS Uninstallation

NixOS can be completely uninstalled by deleting the stub partition, EFI system partition, and root partition off the disk.

Boot back into macOS by shutting down the machine fully, then pressing and holding the power button until the boot picker comes up. Select the macOS installation, then click Continue to boot it. Log into an administrator account and open Terminal.app.

Identify the partitions to remove. In this example, `disk0s3` is the stub because of its small size. `disk0s4` is the EFI system partition and `disk0s5` is the root partition:
```
% diskutil list disk0
/dev/disk0 (internal):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                         1.0 TB     disk0
   1:             Apple_APFS_ISC                         524.3 MB   disk0s1
   2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk4         900.0 GB   disk0s2
   3:                 Apple_APFS Container disk3         2.5 GB     disk0s3
   4:                        EFI EFI - NIXOS             512.8 MB   disk0s4
   5:           Linux Filesystem                         91.6 GB    disk0s5
   6:        Apple_APFS_Recovery                         5.4 GB     disk0s6
```

**WARNING:** Unlike Linux, on macOS each partition's identifier does not necessarily equal its partition index. Double check the identifiers of your own system!

**Remove the EFI system partition and root partition:**
```
% diskutil eraseVolume free free disk0s4
Started erase on disk0s4 (EFI - NIXOS)
Unmounting disk
Finished erase on disk0
% diskutil eraseVolume free free disk0s5
Started erase on disk0s5
Unmounting disk
Finished erase on disk0
```

**Remove the stub partition:**
```
% diskutil apfs deleteContainer disk0s3
Started APFS operation on disk3
Deleting APFS Container with all of its APFS Volumes
[...]
Removing disk0s3 from partition map
```

**Expand the main macOS partition to use the resulting free space. This command will take a few minutes to run; do not attempt to use the machine while it is in progress:**
```
% diskutil apfs resizeContainer disk0s2 0
Started APFS operation
Aligning grow delta to 94,662,586,368 bytes and targeting a new physical store size of 994,662,584,320 bytes
[...]
Finished APFS operation
```
To complete the uninstallation, open the Startup Disk pane of System Preferences and select your macOS installation as the startup disk. If this is not done, the next boot will fail, and you will be asked to select another OS to boot from.

**Most of the hard work, including the kernel and boot software, was done by the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and their development team.**

While you will end up with a fairly usable computer, the exact hardware features you want [may not be ready yet](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/%22When-will-Asahi-Linux-be-done%3F%22). Please look at the [Asahi Linux Feature Support page](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) for information. 

For more general information about Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, refer to the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and [alpha installer release](https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/). 

**Important Note:** Starting from mid-2022, the best advice for getting Debian installed is to be found here: **https://git.zerfleddert.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/m1-debian/.**

#### Artefacts

**If you don't want to use the prebuild artefacts, you can build them yourself using the following scripts:**

   - **prepare_rust.sh** - Prepares a rust installation suitable for kernel compilation
   - **m1n1_uboot_kernel.sh** - Builds m1n1, u-boot and the kernel including gpu support.
   - **mesa.sh** - Creates mesa packages
   - **bootstrap.sh** - Creates Debian root and live filesystem
   - **meta.sh** - Meta package which makes sure that we always get latest and gratest kernel.
    
    
#### Asahi installer

**[Video Recording](https://tg.st/u/debian_asahi_installer.mp4)**

   Poweroff your Mac. Hold and press the power button until you see a wheel chain and Options written below. **Approx 20 seconds**.

   In the boot picker, choose Options. Once loaded, open a Terminal under Utilities > Terminal

   **Run the asahi installer and select Debian:**

   ```curl -sL https://tg.st/d | sh```

  **Follow the installer instructions.**

  **Once Debian is booted log in as root without password and set a root password.**

   ```passwd```
   
   ```pwconv```

  **Configure wifi by editing the wpa_supplicant.conf, enabling the interface and remove the # before allow-hotplug to enable it during boot.**

   ```vi /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf```
   
   ```ifup wlan0```
   
   ```vi /etc/network/interfaces```

   **Reboot to see if grub was correctly installed**

   ```reboot```

   **Install a desktop environment for example blackbox**

   ```apt-get update```
   
   ```apt-get install -y xinit blackbox xterm firefox-esr lightdm```

  **Create yourself an unprivileged user**

   ```useradd -m -c 'Firstname Lastname' -s /bin/bash <username>```
   
   ```passwd <username>```

   **Optional install sshd. You can not log in as root, but only with your unprivileged user**

   ```apt update```
   
   ```apt install -y openssh-server```

   Consult the  **[/root/quickstart.txt](https://git.zerfleddert.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/m1-debian/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/files/quickstart.txt)** file to find out how to do other interesting things.

### Ubuntu Development

* **[Ubuntu Apple Silicon Image](https://github.com/tobhe/ubuntu-asahi)**

**Most of the hard work, including the kernel and boot software, was done by the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and their development team.**

While you will end up with a fairly usable computer, the exact hardware features you want [may not be ready yet](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/%22When-will-Asahi-Linux-be-done%3F%22). Please look at the [Asahi Linux Feature Support page](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Feature-Support) for information. 

For more general information about Linux on Apple Silicon Macs, refer to the [Asahi Linux project](https://asahilinux.org/) and [alpha installer release](https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/). 

#### Installer

**To install a prebuilt image run:**

```
curl -sL https://tobhe.de/ubuntu/install > install.sh	# Download
less install.sh						# Review
sh install.sh						# Run
```

The installer offers a choice of different Ubuntu releases and build configurations.

**Currently supported are:**

  * Ubuntu 22.10 Desktop
  * Ubuntu 22.10 Server
  * Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop
  * Ubuntu 22.04 Server

The default **username and password are both ```ubuntu```.** Root access can be achieved via ```sudo```.


### Dual-booting macOS and Linux

Yes, The installer can automatically resize your macos partition according to your liking and install Ubuntu in the freed up space. Removing macOS is not supported at the moment since it is required to update the system firmware.

### Building

If you do not want to use the prebuilt disk image, you can build one yourself with the instructions below.

```
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install arch-install-scripts debootstrap mtools parted gnupg eatmydata rsync git squashfs-tools zip

# Install dependencies, if your builder system is NOT arm64
sudo apt-get install binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static
````
#### Build

```
cd ubuntu-asahi
# Build the entire live image
sudo ./build-generic.sh
```
The live GPT image file will be output to ```build/ubuntu.live.img```, the zip archive for the Asahi Linux installer will be output to ```build/ubuntu.live.img.zip```.

#### Clean

The clean.sh script will clean up the build folder, except for the cache folder, which is used by debootstrap to cache debs.

```
cd ubuntu-asahi
# Clean the build folder
./clean.sh
```

[ARM64EC (âEmulation Compatibleâ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/arm64ec) is a new application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64 architecture. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match with ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARMâs built-in emulation. The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the current [ARM64 ABI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160) in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.
